# Problem statement
The project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. Machine Learning techniques like Naive Bayes, KNN, and ensemble methods are used to draw inferences. Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets. Also perform descriptive analysis based on the speeches by the election candidates.
# Learnings:
1. Problem-Solving:
* Part 1: Built predictive models (Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest) to forecast voter preferences.
* Part 2: Conducted text analysis on U.S. presidential speeches to derive political priorities across decades.
2. Model Development:
* Achieved the highest AUC score (0.884) with Random Forest for voter predictions, optimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning.
* Addressed dataset imbalance with robust evaluation techniques like AUC-ROC.
3. Text Analysis:
* Used word clouds and frequency analysis to highlight key themes and evolving rhetoric in presidential speeches.
4. Technical Skills:
* Applied ensemble methods, text preprocessing, and visualizations using Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
5. Professional Insights:
* Gained expertise in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems across domains.
* Improved analytical and presentation skills, showcasing versatility in handling structured and unstructured data.
