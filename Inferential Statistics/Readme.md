# Problem Statement
Analyze the datasets provided and use the concepts of Inferential Statistics to solve business problems and answer specific questions - insights on stone suitability for printing, the effectiveness of a fitness program, and the impact of dentists and implant methods on metal implant hardness - to enable data-driven decision-making and operational improvements.
# Objective
In this project, we analysed datasets to solve business problems using various concepts of inferential statistics. The methodologies applied included probability, hypothesis testing, and ANOVA.
# Challenges Faced
The most significant challenge was performing a two-way ANOVA test to find the interaction effect between groups. This was addressed by first checking the p-values for the independent variables separately and then by combining them to understand their interaction.
# Technological and Methodological Learning
This project provided hands-on experience with Python, specifically using statistical libraries like StatsModels and SciPy, along with data manipulation libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
# Professional and Personal Growth
The project was instrumental in understanding how to solve business problems using real-world data and inferential statistics. It enhanced my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
# Future Application
The knowledge and skills gained from this project will be invaluable in my career as a data scientist. The experience in solving business problems using inferential statistics will be particularly useful when facing similar challenges in the real world.
