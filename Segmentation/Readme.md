# Problem Statement
The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data. 1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques. 2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.
# Objective
In this data analysis project, we analysed datasets and performed clustering and dimensionality reduction. The project required applying data science methodologies, specifically unsupervised learning techniques for clustering and dimensionality reduction, as well as visualization techniques for evaluation and optimization.In this data analysis project, we analysed datasets and performed clustering and dimensionality reduction.

# Challenges Faced
The most significant challenges were finding the optimum number of clusters to group data objectively and determining the optimum number of dimensions that account for the highest amount of variance while minimizing noise. These were addressed using K-means clustering and dendrograms for clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
# Technological and Methodological Learning
This project provided hands-on experience with Python, particularly with data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. It also enhanced my understanding of clustering and PCA for unsupervised learning, which were crucial for effectively grouping data and reducing noise by transforming the data.
# Professional and Personal Growth
The project was instrumental in deepening my understanding of the unsupervised learning branch of machine learning. It provided valuable experience working with real-world data, preparing me for similar challenges in the corporate sector. Additionally, it honed my ability to present complex analyses in an understandable manner, thereby improving my communication skills.
# Future Application
The knowledge and skills gained from this project will be extremely helpful in my data analytics journey. Experience with clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization will be particularly beneficial in tackling business challenges and supporting data-driven decision-making in future roles.
