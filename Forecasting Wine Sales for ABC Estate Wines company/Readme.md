# Problem Statement
Analyzed historical monthly sales data of a company. Created multiple forecast models for two different products of a particular Wine Estate and recommended the optimum forecasting model to predict monthly sales for the next 12 months along with appropriate lower and upper confidence limits.
# Objective
To forecast wine sales for ABC Estate Wines using historical data, identifying trends and seasonality to support data-driven decision-making.
# Learnings
* Advanced Modelling: Gained hands-on experience with time series forecasting models like ARIMA and SARIMA, alongside simpler techniques like moving averages and exponential smoothing.
* Stationarity Techniques: Learned to check and transform non-stationary data to stationary, critical for building robust time series models.
* Tool Proficiency: Strengthened my Python programming skills using libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
* Professional Growth: Understood the impact of seasonality on sales patterns, enabling me to make strategic recommendations for inventory and marketing alignment with business cycles.
