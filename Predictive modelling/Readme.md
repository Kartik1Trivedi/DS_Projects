# Problem statement
This project has two parts a) Computer-activ Project using Linear Regression which aims to predict the percentage time the computer remains in user mode. b) Women's contraceptive Project using Classification techniques to classify how many women use or not use contraceptive
# Objective
This project had two parts. The first part involved finding the best-fit linear equation to predict the percentage of time a computer remains in user mode. The second part focused on building a classification model to calculate the probability that a woman will use contraceptives. This project required the application of data science methodologies, including supervised learning for regression and classification, and visualization techniques for evaluation and optimization.
# Challenges Faced
One of the key challenges was building a stable model that could make accurate predictions while minimizing bias and variance. To address this, I focused on reducing multicollinearity within the data and applied various modelling techniques to identify the best-performing model. By systematically testing and refining these models, I achieved a balance between precision and generalization.
# Technological and Methodological Learning
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Python, particularly with data manipulation libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also enhanced my understanding of regression and classification techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and linear discriminant analysis, which were crucial for accurate predictions.
# Professional and Personal Growth
his project was instrumental in understanding how to build and train statistical models for making predictions. It provided valuable experience working with real-world data, preparing me for similar challenges in future roles. Additionally, it improved my ability to present complex analyses in an understandable manner, significantly enhancing my communication skills.
# Future Application
The knowledge and skills acquired from this project will be extremely helpful for my journey in data analytics. The experience with statistical modelling and data visualization will be particularly beneficial in tackling business challenges and supporting data-driven decision-making in future roles.
